[Enter Hamlet and Horatio on stage]

Hamlet:
Good morrow, Horatio. I prithee, tell me, what can we speak of that will cause a greeting to appear?

Horatio:
Good morrow, my lord. We may speak of the arrival of the sun, which does bring light and warmth to our fair land.

Hamlet:
Ah, the sun! The brightest orb in all the heavens, whose rays doth bring joy to all who bask in its light. But how can we summon it forth?

Horatio:
Marry, my lord, we may speak its name and offer it salutations. Thusly, I shall say, "Hail, oh wondrous sun, whose radiance doth make glad the hearts of all!"

Hamlet:
Indeed, Horatio, thy words doth stir my heart with gladness. And so, I shall say, "Hail, oh wondrous sun, whose radiance doth make glad the hearts of all!"

[They both bow to the imaginary sun]

Hamlet:
And now, Horatio, we have spoken our greetings to the sun, and thus we have caused a greeting to appear. Truly, this is a wondrous thing.

Horatio:
Indeed, my lord, for the power of language is great, and by our words we can summon forth the very elements of nature.

[Exeunt]
